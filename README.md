# form
## About
This is my attempt to recreate ProofHub's sign-up form from scratch. There are certain features that I cannot replicate due to inaccessibility to their back-end server. For example, when users plug in their own URL, ProofHub server will check to see if it's still available for use. In my case, I cannot implement that since I don't have their database.

This sign-up form is mobile-friendly. And the form validation is done via Vanilla JS.
